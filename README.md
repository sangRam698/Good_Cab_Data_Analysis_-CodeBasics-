ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  :
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It currently operates in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. The company plans to expand to other metros and Tier 1 cities in the next two years.

However, AtliQ Mart is facing a critical issue where some key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service-related concerns. It is speculated that essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full consistently, leading to poor customer experience.

To address this issue, the management has tasked the supply chain analytics team with tracking the On-Time (OT) %, In-Full (IF) %, and On-Time In-Full (OTIF) % delivery service levels for all customers on a daily basis. This will allow them to respond swiftly and improve service levels before expanding into new markets.
